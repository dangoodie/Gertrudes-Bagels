TinDog Starting Files

Hi!

I used the Tindog course as a jumping off point to make a slightly different start up website called Bagel Buddy. It's a fictional bagel delivery service that let's you get a bagel subscription. Rediculous, I know haha. Anyways, if you want to check it out go to https://dangoodie.github.io/bagel-buddy

Enjoy!
